After introducing huawei-iflytek devices boot process, let's start hacking!.

For BZT-W09 and similar old chips devices(kirin 6xx, 710,960 and older chips except 970,980,990,710a),

First ,we need to enter vcom download mode and try to interact with the port and upload a full-function fastboot.

Then ,we need to backup origin os via this fasrtboot.

Then ,we need to rewrite nvme partition to rewrite the SHA256 of the unlock code and FBLOCK state.

Then ,we can flash TWRP recovery.

Then ,we can flash normal system or do dual-booting.

However,for newer devices,because download mode also checks the signature of xloader and uce.

But ,in fact ,if we do not install Huawei newer OTA update, the download mode is still available.

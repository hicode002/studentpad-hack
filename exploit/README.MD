usage:
Download directory pulish\.

Then run idt2.exe,follow the instuctions in the program.

Need to install huawei testpoint driver and net. framework.

fastboot.img: origin encrypted image 

fastboot710a_dec.img: origin decrypted image 

fastboot710a_dec_patched3.img: Use FBLOCK,USERLOCK patch,and use dts_init patch to make the screen lit. 

fastboot710a_dec_patched5.img Use FBLOCK patch and use dts_init patch to make the screed lighted.(Recommend Use)

uce.img:origin uce,extracted from origin xloader.img 

xloader_710a_orig.img:origin xloader (removed uce parts,can be used at download mode)

xloader_710a_patched2.img: uce verification bypass,inquiry command patched,used to decrypt bootloader.  

xloader_710a_patched3.img:uce verification bypass,fastboot verification bypass. (Recommend Use)

Common use for all kIRIN710a devices

If you want to port it to other socs,you need to know the return address of download_xloader function
  in fact you just need to know the stack edge in bootrom.
And then you need to know the start address of xloader

For decompiling xloader,just use ida,inputing 0x22000  as loading address
then find the first function(e.g 0x2316a 0x2316c ) and select the whole function,click right mouse,click analyze.
  Then xloader will automatically be reversed.
For decompiling fastboot,get function symbol table at the end  of the fastboot image.
But for newer socs,huawei removed it.
use ida inputing 0x1C000000 as loading address.
Then just press P to create function at needed location.
IDA will not reverse it automatically.



Now we can make the temporary fastboot boot to kernel.run,fastboot oem boot command,then the phone auto starts.
So now we can make temporary root access like checkm8

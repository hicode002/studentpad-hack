[ti:Dream it Possible]
[00:08]I will run, I will climb, I will soar
[00:13]I'm undefeated
[00:16]Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
[00:21]Yeah I believe it
[00:24]The past is everything we were don't make us who we are
[00:31]So I'll dream, until I make it real, and all I see is stars
[00:39]It's not until you fall that you fly
[00:44]When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable
[00:47]Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
[00:51]We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
[00:56]And we'll dream it possible
[01:03]Possible
[01:12]And we'll dream it possible
[01:16]I will chase, I will reach, I will fly
[01:21]Until I'm breaking, until I'm breaking
[01:24]Out of my cage, like a bird in the night
[01:29]I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing
[01:32]In, into something big, better than before
[01:40]And if it takes, takes a thousand lives
[01:43]Then it's worth fighting for
[01:46]It's not until you fall that you fly
[01:52]When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable
[01:56]Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
[02:00]We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
[02:03]And we'll dream it possible
[02:07]
[02:14]It possible
[02:24]From the bottom to the top
[02:26]We're sparking wild fires
[02:28]Never quit and never stop
[02:30]The rest of our lives
[02:32]From the bottom to the top
[02:34]We're sparking wild fires
[02:36]Never quit and never stop
[02:39]It's not until you fall that you fly
[02:45]When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable
[02:49]Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
[02:53]We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
[02:58]And we'll dream it possible
[03:05]Possible
[03:14]And we'll dream it possible
[03:19]

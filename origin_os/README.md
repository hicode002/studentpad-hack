### This is the origin_os backup.

Because We use a user's pad to get the image,so due to protecting the user's private information,We can't give  the userdata.img.

And to get the iflytek initial userdata.img ,we need to do a iflytek factory reset （because the iflytek software are in userdata.img，we can't just erase userdata） and then get the image,but I am still doing research about it now.

 because of the github's big file limit,I put them  in releases.

Now I have published iflytek userdata's hw_init folder.

It is one of the most important parts of the iflytek controlled system.

Now , we can make really recovering to turn your bricked devices to iflytek initial devices.

And we can do dual boot on any BZT-W09 devices including C00.

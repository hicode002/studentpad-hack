### This is the origin_os backuo.

Because We use a user's pad to get the image,so due to protecting the user's private information,We can't give  the userdata.img.

And to get the iflytek initial userdata.img ,we need to do a iflytek factory reset and then get the image,but I am still doing research about it now.
